# Raytracer
This example demonstrates a simple raytracer with phong shading and basic reflections, 
where a collection of spheres rotate around a light.

The spheres are rendered using the ``primitives.drawPoint`` feature, where the visuals are scaled
by rendering to a surface and scaling that surface to the size of the canvas.

By default, the resolution is ridiculously low (12x10 pixels)!
However, **the resolution of the rendered scene can be increased** by clicking on the canvas.
