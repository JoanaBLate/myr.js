# Raytracer
This example demonstrates a simple raytracer with phong shading and basic reflections.
A collection of spheres rotate around a light.
The spheres are rendered using the point draw command, where the visuals are up-scaled
by rendering to a surface and scaling that surface to the size of the canvas.
